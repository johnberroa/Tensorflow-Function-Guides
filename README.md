# Tensorflow Function Guides

There are a few things that I found to not be really intuitive when it comes to Tensorflow. Within these notebooks are functions that are useful, yet aren't very well explained from a decent Google search.

## Includes:
* tf.cond
* tf.image.<> (augmentation, i.e. random_brightness)
* tf.placeholder_with_default
